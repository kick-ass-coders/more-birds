# Birding Oracle v2 Proposal

## Machine Learning and Image Classification
With this second iteration of Bird Oracle, we have improved our application by integrating machine learning and image classification. We built our model using Tensorflow.

Using our model, several thousand photographs of birds, and most of our sanity, we have created an image classification system aiming to provide users with an easy-to-use method of bird identification. After uploading their own bird image, our application will return the type of bird our entrepid birder has captured. It's all very exciting. 

## Additional Updates
We also made several asthetic updates to our dashboard and included a searchable table for our users to more easily access the species search codes. 

Our original dashboard, with some of the proposed improvements, can be found <a href="https://avian-adventure.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
